This is my final project for CSCE350. It has quicksort and mergesort implemented. You must compile the code using 'make' and then run the code using ./Sort
Once the code is running, it will ask you to choose whether you want to sort using quicksort or mergesort. Next it will ask for the size of the array (how many elements) you want to sort. And finally, it will ask for the file name where your integer list is that needs to be sorted as well as the file name to store the sorted list. Use format "file.txt". It will then sort the integers, output it on the screen, and save it in a text file.
